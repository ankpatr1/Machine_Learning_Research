          "text_1": "Recent archaeological discoveries in Egypt have shed new light on the process of mummification. These findings indicate that the ancient Egyptians had a sophisticated understanding of anatomy and preservation techniques. It was significantly important to maintain the deceased body in a lifelike state due to the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians. The discovery of well-preserved internal organs within mummies suggests that their knowledge extended beyond the preservation of just the body.",
          "text_2": "Insights into our enhanced comprehension of the Egyptian mummification process, the surrounding culture, and the actual procedure largely stem from the detailed writings of ancient historians like Herodotus, who meticulously documented these practices during his travels to Egypt around 450 BCE. Advances in technology, such as the use of X-rays, now facilitate the examination of mummies without disturbing their intricate outer coverings, enabling archaeologists to view intricate details like organs and bone conditions."

At the time, China’s rapid population growth placed a strain on resources, leading the government to hastily announce the one-child policy. While fertility has declined since 1980, researchers are hesitant to attribute this decline to the one-child policy because the rate had already started to decline prior to 1980.
