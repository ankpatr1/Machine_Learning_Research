A research team led by Yashraj Bhosale wanted to better understand the mechanics behind these structural properties. Bhosale’s team used laboratory models that simulated the arrangement of flexible sticks into nest-like structures. The researchers analyzed the points where sticks touched one another. When pressure was applied to the model nests, the number of contact points between the sticks increased, making the structures stiffer.",
