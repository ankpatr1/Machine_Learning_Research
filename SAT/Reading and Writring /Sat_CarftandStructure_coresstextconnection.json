Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious—Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sufficient evidence of Fletcher’s authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger.",
        "text2": "Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare’s complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the first act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts.",

Text 2 states that scholars generally agree 'on the basis of style' that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts. Both texts imply that Fletcher’s writing has a unique, readily identifiable style that can be used to distinguish his work from others. Choice B is incorrect because neither text compares the women of Fletcher’s plays to those in Massinger’s plays; Text 2 doesn’t mention Massinger at all. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 implies that Sykes disputed Shakespeare’s coauthorship. Choice D is incorrect because neither text suggests that Massinger was inspired by Shakespeare.",

They claim that more voters doesn’t equal more quality votes—instead, they argue that forced voting may lead to less-informed votes that 'may not reflect [voters’] actual preferences.' Choice A is incorrect because neither text mentions the population size of countries that require voting, or how that might affect election outcomes.

Choice A is incorrect because while the author of Text 2 gives an example of a nanohybrid that isn’t as toxic as its constituent parts, they don’t argue that the benefit outweighs the risk. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 states that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation 'vary by case,' and that the attention that their potential toxicity has drawn is warranted.

A change in Earth’s orbit that affected climate has been posited as a cause of desertification, but archaeologist David Wright also attributes the shift to Neolithic peoples.

Umami—one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, salty, and sour—was formally classified when its taste receptors were discovered in the 2000s. In 2007, to define the pure umami flavor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O’Mahony used broths made from shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed, and two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agreed on a description of the taste.",

The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce. Further analysis of soy sauce identified proteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami flavor and also contributed to saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that re-created soy sauce’s flavor.",

Although Lewis sculpted other subjects, her career as a sculptor is best represented by the works in which she depicted these historical and mythical themes.",

Lewis likely carved these busts (sculptures of a person’s head) frequently throughout her long career. She is known for her sculptures that represent historical figures, but Lewis likely supported herself financially by carving portrait busts for acquaintances who paid her to represent their features. Thus, Lewis’s portrait busts are a central aspect of her career as a sculptor.",

        "text1": "Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources. According to conventional wisdom, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists’ many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t uncovered a satisfactory explanation.",
        "text2": "Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.",
        "question": "Based on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the 'conventional wisdom' discussed in Text 1?",

          "A": "By arguing that it is based on a misconception about phytoplankton species competing with one another",
          "B": "By asserting that it fails to recognize that routine replenishment of ocean nutrients prevents competition between phytoplankton species",
          "C": "By suggesting that their own findings help clarify how phytoplankton species are able to compete with larger organisms",

        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because, based on Text 2, Behrenfeld and colleagues attribute the persistence of many phytoplankton species to a reduced level of direct competition due to the organisms’ microscopic size and the way they are spaced apart in water. This directly challenges the conventional view from Text 1 that intense competition should allow only one species to dominate.

        "text1": "A team led by Bernardo Strassburg has found that rewilding farmland (returning the land to its natural state) could help preserve biodiversity and offset carbon emissions. The amount of farmland that would need to be restored, they found, is remarkably low. Rewilding a mere 15% of the world’s current farmland would prevent 60% of expected species extinctions and help absorb nearly 299 gigatons of carbon dioxide—a clear win in the fight against the biodiversity and climate crises.",
        "text2": "While Strassburg’s team’s findings certainly offer encouraging insight into the potential benefits of rewilding, it’s important to consider potential effects on global food supplies. The researchers suggest that to compensate for the loss of food-producing land, remaining farmland would need to produce even more food. Thus, policies focused on rewilding farmland must also address strategies for higher-yield farming.",

Text 1 is highly optimistic about Strassburg’s findings, describing the potential outcomes as a 'clear win' for both biodiversity preservation and carbon dioxide absorption.

As the researchers fitted each magpie with a tracker attached by a small harness, they noticed some magpies without trackers pecking at another magpie’s tracker until it broke off. The researchers suggest that this behavior could be evidence of magpies attempting to help another magpie without benefiting themselves.",
        "text2": "It can be tempting to think that animals are deliberately providing help when we see them removing trackers and other equipment from one another, especially when a species is known to exhibit other cooperative behaviors. At the same time, it can be difficult to exclude the possibility that individuals are simply interested in the equipment because of its novelty, curiously pawing or pecking at it until it detaches.",
