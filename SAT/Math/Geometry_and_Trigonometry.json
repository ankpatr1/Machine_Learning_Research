      "rationale": "Choice A is correct. The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h. Given V = 45π and h = 5, substitute into the formula: 45π = πr² × 5. Divide both sides by 5π to get r² = 9. Taking the square root of both sides gives r = 3. Since radius cannot be negative, the radius is 3.
