The median is the middle data value when the data values are sorted from least to greatest. Since there are 20 ages ordered, the median is the average of the two middle values, the 10th and 11th, which for these data are both 19. Therefore, the median is 19. The mean is the sum of the data values divided by the number of the data values. So for these data, the mean is (18×6 + 19×5 + 20×4 + 21×2 + 22×1 + 23×1 + 30×1) / 20 = 20. Since the mode is 18, the median is 19, and the mean is 20, mode < median < mean. Choices B and D are incorrect because the mean is greater than the median. Choice C is incorrect because the median is greater than the mode.",
